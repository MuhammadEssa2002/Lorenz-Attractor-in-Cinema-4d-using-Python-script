## Lorenz Attractor

The **Lorenz Attractor** is a system of three nonlinear differential equations originally developed by Edward Lorenz in 1963 to model atmospheric convection. It is famous for its chaotic behavior and its iconic butterfly-shaped trajectory in three-dimensional space.

The system shows how small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes, a concept known as the "butterfly effect" in chaos theory. The Lorenz attractor is widely studied in mathematics, physics, and chaos theory due to its complex, unpredictable behavior despite being based on simple equations.
